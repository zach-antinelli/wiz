Thank you for the opportunity! I've laid out my architecture and overview of the solutions based on the provided instructions.

## üìñ Table of Contents

- **[Technology Stack](#technology-stack)**
  Overview of the tools and technologies used.

- **[Misconfigurations](#misconfigurations)**
  Identified issues and their remediations.

- **[Security Tools](#security-tools)**
  - üîç **[Detective](#detective)**: Tools for monitoring and detection.

## Technology stack

- Terraform infrastructure deployment
- Web Application
  - EC2 instance running DB
    - Overly permissive IAM role
    - DB allows local authentication
    - DB Backup automation to S3
- K8S cluster
  - Container with webapp running with cluster admin SA
- S3 Bucket for object storage
  - Database backups
  - Scripts, content
- Code stored in GitHub
- GitHub actions pipelines
  - Automate Terraform deployment
  - Build and push image to ECR

## Misconfigurations

- IMDSv1 for EC2 instance
  - [AWS Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/get-the-full-benefits-of-imdsv2-and-disable-imdsv1-across-your-aws-infrastructure/)
  - Remediated with Security Hub
- ? for DB
- ? for K8S
