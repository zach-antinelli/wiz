## Technology stack

- Terraform infrastructure deployment
- Web application
  - Custom app built with Python: [gensen](web-app/gensen)
  - Custom helm chart to deploy app: [helm](web-app/helm)
  - Hosted publicly at [wiz-tech-exercise.zachantinelli.me](https://wiz-tech-exercise.zachantinelli.me)
- K8S cluster
  - Pod with web app running cluster admin SA
  - Load balancer controller manages ingress and ALB access to webapp
- EC2 instance running DB
  - Overly permissive IAM role
  - DB allows local authentication
  - DB Backup automation to S3
- S3 Bucket for object storage
  - Database backups
- Code stored in GitHub
- GitHub actions pipelines
  - Automate Terraform deployment
  - Build and push image to ECR

## Misconfigurations

- IMDSv1 for EC2 instance
  - Remediated with Lambda function executed through AWS Config
- EKS cluster endpoint available on `0.0.0.0/0`
  - Remediated with Lambda function executed through AWS Config
